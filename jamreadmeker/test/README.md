  ## Credits
  I would like to thank Georige Tech for the amazing course they taught me through. As well as for my instructor Stanley Lewis who did a tremendous job breaking everything we've learned to bit size pieces. I also want to thank my peers for working with me and helping me out with questions and homework. Youtube University was also and amazing help combined with Ghost Engergy drinks it made my learing just alittle more managable.
